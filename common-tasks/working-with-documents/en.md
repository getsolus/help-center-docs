# Working with Documents

Solus comes pre-installed with LibreOffice, an office suite that is capable of replacing Microsoft<sup>TM</sup> Office for the most common tasks. By default, Solus provides Writer (Word replacement), Calc (Excel replacement), and Impress (PowerPoint replacement). Other applications such as Math can be installed from the Software Center. 

## Writer

### Spell-checking

LibreOffice Writer users may want to install the package `libreoffice-common-dictionaries` from Software Center to automatically enable spell-checking support. Finnish users may also want to install `libreoffice-voikko`.

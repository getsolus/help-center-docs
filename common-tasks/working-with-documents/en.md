# Working with office

Solus comes pre-installed with LibreOffice, an office suite that is capable of replacing Microsoft Office for the most common tasks.
Unless you are a heavy power user, LibreOffice should provide you with all the tools needed to solve your daily office challenges.
LibreOffice Writer users may want to install the package `libreoffice-common-dictionaries` from Software Center to automatically enable spell-checking support.

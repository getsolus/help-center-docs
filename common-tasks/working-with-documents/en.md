# Working with Documents

Solus comes pre-installed with LibreOffice, an office suite that is capable of replacing Microsoft<sup>TM</sup> Office for the most common tasks.
 
By default, Solus provides Writer (document editor), Calc (spreadsheet editor), and Impress (presentation editor). Other applications such as Math or Draw can be installed from the Software Center. 

## Writer

### Spell-checking

LibreOffice Writer users may want to install the package `libreoffice-common-dictionaries` from Software Center to automatically enable spell-checking support. Finnish users may also want to install `libreoffice-voikko`.

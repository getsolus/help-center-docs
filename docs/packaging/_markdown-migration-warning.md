We are currently in the process of migrating our source repositories from Phabricator to GitHub. If you have any repos checked out from Phabricator, [migrate them](docs/packaging/procedures/migrate-repo-to-github.md) before proceeding.

Updating all facets of the documentation will take some time.
If you notice any issues feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/getsolus/help-center-docs/issues/new) on our docs tracker, or get in contact with us on our [Matrix](/docs/user/contributing/getting-involved.md#matrix-chat) channels.

title: Package YAML
summary: Learning the package.yml packaging format
---

# `package.yml`

Each package is generated from a single build file named `package.yml`. This file is sometimes also called a "recipe" since it provides steps for building a package. It provides all of the required metadata for the package manager, plus the packaging steps involved to produce a package. This file follows the YAML specification.

## Format

All `package.yml` files **must** be valid YAML.

The file is organised into a key→value hierarchy. The `ypkg` tool parses a `package.yml` file to build the corresponding package in a declarative manner. As such, most of the keys are simple strings, lists or nested key→value pairs. A special case consists in the packaging steps, which are scripts.

An example file follows:

## Keys

Not all fields in `package.yml` are mandatory, but a small selection are. Below is the complete list of the available fields.

### Mandatory Keys

| Key Name        | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **name**        | `string`    | The name of the package. This is also used as the base of all sub-package names. Unless unavoidable, this should match the upstream name.                                                                           |
| **version**     | `string`    | The version of the currently packaged software. This is taken from the tarball in most cases.                                                                                                                       |
| **release**     | `integer`   | Specifies the current release number. Updates in the package number are based on this `release` number, _not_ the `version` number. As such, to release an update to users, this number must be incremented by one. |
| **source**      | `dict(s)`   | Upstream source URL (i.e. tarball), with the valid `sha256sum` as a value. Alternatively, the git repository URL prefixed with "git&#124;" and a git tag or commit hash as a value.                                 |
| **homepage**    | `string`    | Provides a link to the package's homepage, used in the Software Center.                                                                                                                                             |
| **license**     | `string(s)` | Valid upstream license(s). Try to ensure these use [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/).                                                                                                                  |
| **summary**     | `string`    | Brief package summary, or display name.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **component**   | `string`    | Component / group of packages this package belongs to. Check available components via `eopkg lc`.                                                                                                                   |
| **description** | `string`    | More extensive description of the software, usually taken from the vendor website.                                                                                                                                  |

| **conflicts**   | `string(s)` | Specify packages that cannot be installed together with this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **optimize**    | `list`      | Specify preset keys to modify compiler and linker flags during build. You can learn more [here](/docs/packaging/package.yml#optimize-values).                                                                                                                                         |
| **builddeps**   | `list`      | Specify build dependencies for the package. You can learn more [here](/docs/packaging/packaging-practices#build-dependencies).                                                                                                                                                        |

| **checkdeps**   | `dict(s)`   | Specify build dependencies for the package which will _not_ be considered when determining build order for automatic builds. These dependencies should only be used during the `check` build phase. You can learn more [here](/docs/packaging/packaging-practices#check-dependencies) |
| **replaces**    | `dict(s)`   | Replace one package with another, used when renaming or deprecating packages for clean upgrade paths.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **patterns**    | `dict(s)`   | Allows fine grained control over file placement within the package or sub-packages.

### Packaging Step Keys, optional

The packaging steps are all considered optional, however the absence of the `install` step will result in no package generated. Each of these keys contains content that will be placed within a script and executed within a controlled environment to perform the package build. For all intents and purposes, they are Bash scripts with a predefined environment.

| Step Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **setup**   | Performed after the source extraction. This is the correct place to perform any `configure` routine, or to `patch` the sources.                            |
| **build**   | Use this step to run the build portion, for example, `make`.                                                                                               |
| **install** | This is where you should install the files into the final packaging directory, for example, `make install`.                                                |
| **check**   | This is where tests / checking should occur, for example, `make check`.                                                                                    |
| **profile** | This is where profiling tests should be specified. `ypkg` will handle setting flags to generate profiling data and using that data for an optimized build. |

## Optimize values

One or more optimize values can be specified in a list with the `optimize` key in the `package.yml` file. Several values can override or conflict with each other and should be used only where they provide a performance benefit, or fix a bug in the package or build.

| Optimize Value                  | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **speed**                       | Optimizes the package for performance `-O3` plus other flags.                                                                                     |
| **size**                        | Optimizes the package build to minimize size `-Os`. Not supported with clang.                                                                     |
| **no-bind-now**                 | Configures the package to disable certain flags, where RELRO is unsupported.                                                                      |
| **no-symbolic**                 | Disables `-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions` linker flag.                                                                                                  |
| **unroll-loops**                | Enables `-funroll-loops`. Use this sparingly, only when it provides proven benefit.                                                               |
| **runpath**                     | Enables `-Wl,--enable-new-dtags` to make linker use RUNPATH's instead of RPATH's.                                                                 |
| **avx256**                      | Disables `-mprefer-vector-width=128` in avx2 builds.                                                                                              |
| **thin-lto**                    | Enables Thin Link Time Optimization `-flto=thin` with a supported linker.                                                                         |
| **lto**                         | Enables Link Time Optimization `-flto`.                                                                                                           |
| **icf-safe**                    | Enables safe Identical Cold Folding `--icf=safe`. `function-sections` is recommended when not using clang. Uses gold linker when not using clang. |
| **icf-all**                     | Enables Identical Cold Folding `--icf=all`. `function-sections` is recommended when not using clang. Uses gold linker when not using clang.       |
| **polly**                       | Enables polyhedral optimizations for the clang toolchain.                                                                                         |
| **function-sections**           | Generate a separate ELF section for each function. Recommended with ICF when not using clang.                                                     |
| **no-reorder-blocks-partition** | Disables block partition reordering with the gcc toolchain. Provided to facilitate BOLT'ed binaries/libraries.                                    |
| **emit-relocs**                 | Instructs the linker to emit relocations. Provided to facilitate BOLT'ed binaries/libraries.                                                      |

To further assist in packaging, a number of macros are available. These are simply shorthand ways to perform a normal build operation. They also ensure that the resulting package is consistent. These macros are only available in our packaging steps, as they are substituted within the script before execution.

### Usage

Macros are prefixed with `%`, and are substituted before your script is executed. Macros ending with `%` are used to provide directory names or build values to the script.

```bash
# Run the configure macro with the given arguments
%configure --disable-static
```

| **$workdir**       | The work, or source, directory of the package build.                                             |

## Types

The `package.yml` file uses native YAML types, however it follows syntactic conventions and may accept multiple value types for a given key.

### string

This is simply text, which does not need to be quoted.

### string(s)

Indicates that it is possible to use a `list` of strings, or one single `string`.

### integer

Whole, positive number, used in the `release` field.

### list

A YAML list (or array) can be expressed in multiple ways. A short array-notation would look like this:

`[one, two, three]`

They can also be expressed like this:

```yaml
- First Value
- Second Value
- Third Value
```

### dict

Known as an associative array, this is key to value mapping. These are separated by a colon (`:`), the token on the left is taken to be a key, and the token on the right is the value.

`SomeKey: Some Value`

Note that each `ypkg key` in the YAML file is actually a dict.

### dict(s)

`dict(s)` consists of a list of `dict`s and some assumptions. We primarily make use of this to express advanced information within the package. These permit you to provide no key, and a value only.
In this instance, the key is implicitly assumed to be the package name (for example, `nano`):

`- some value`

An explicit key, usually a sub-package name:

`- somekey: somevalue`

A mix of both:

```yaml
- somevalue
- somekey: another value
```

The values may also be expressed in list form, still using the same default key logic:

```yaml
- [one, two, three]
- somekey: [one, two, three]
- key:
    - value one
    - value two
    - value three
```

## Packaging Practices

The concepts in this document merely expose the syntax of a `package.yml` file. Solus adheres to strict packaging practices and conventions which packagers must follow. They are explained in the [Packaging Practices](/docs/packaging/packaging-practices) article.

# Requesting A Package Update

Packages updates are typically provided by community or dedicated package maintainers, however if we are not shipping the latest stable release of a package, you can let us know using our [Issue Tracker](https://issues.getsol.us/)

**Please look to see if an update request has already been filed for the software or library you require**.

If there isn't an existing request, you can use the template below for requesting to update a package. Note that updates solely for a new version number, platform-specific updates (such as to macOS or Windows) which aren't relevant, or solely translation updates, are generally not accepted or not prioritized.

Please provide the following information:

- Title of Task: `Update $packagename to $version`
- Example: `Update nano to 2.9.7`
- Description: Explanation as to the value-add of updating this package.
- Link to source tarball/zip file
- master.zip files **are not permitted**. We require versioned tarballs, for example: "1.2.3.tar.gz".
- Use the tag **Software** for tagging your update request

Please put this information into a new [issue](https://github.com/getsolus/packages/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Package+Request&projects=&template=request-package-update.yaml)

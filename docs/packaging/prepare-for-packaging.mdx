# Prepare for Packaging

## Switch to the Unstable Repository

Packages need to be built and tested against the "unstable" repository. If you don't want to switch your primary system to unstable, you can do your packaging work in a VM. We have Virtual Machine Manager in the repos.

Refer to [Repository Management](docs/user/package-management/repo-management) to see how to add and switch to unstable.

## Setting up the Packager file

In order to utilize the build system, you must first set up a configuration file that has your packager details.

This file lives in the `.config/solus` folder of your home directory. You will need to create the `.config/solus` folder as well as the inner `packager` file. Inside the packager file, you need two keys, `Name` and `Email`. This is used when generating the machine file so that the packager details are stored within the resulting binary package.

Name and email address are mandatory. You must use your real first and last name(s) for accountability purposes.
A [Matrix](/docs/user/contributing/getting-involved#matrix-chat) contact is optional but recommended.

```ini
[Packager]
Name=Your Name Here
Email=your.email@address
Matrix=@username.matrix.org
```

## Installing Development Tools

We need to install a few things in order to get started with packaging.
The main packages we need are provided by the `system.devel` component.

Namely:

- `ypkg` the program that actually builds packages
- `make` used by our build tools for scripting

```bash
sudo eopkg it -c system.devel
```

Additionally, we need a few more tools to carry out the packaging process:

- `git` is used for version control of the solus sources
- `github-cli` is used to make working with GitHub easier
- `solbuild` is a lightweight container environment for building packages repeatably
- `solbuild-config-unstable` sets up solbuild for working with the `unstable` repository

```bash
sudo eopkg it git github-cli solbuild solbuild-config-unstable
```

## Setting up a GitHub account

The Solus source repositories for the package repository currently reside on [github.com/solus-packages](https://github.com/solus-packages). You will need a GitHub account to submit patches and file issues. You can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup). Note that you will also need to set up [2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)(two factor authentication) for your account.

### Configure `github-cli`.

Once you have a GitHub account, you need to configure `github-cli` to work with it. At minimum, you need to run `gh auth login`. Have your GitHub credentials and 2FA (two factor authentication) mechanism at hand.

See the [GitHub CLI quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart) for some common uses of the tool.

## Setting up solbuild

The `solbuild` tool must first be initialized with a base image. All builds thereafter will use this as a base, and construct a temporary overlay root to save on time and disk space in builds.

Initialize solbuild via:

```bash
sudo solbuild init
```

This will take some time as it downloads and prepares the image.

### Updating solbuild

It is a good idea to keep the base image updated. It will help reduce build times by not having to repeatedly download updates to packages in the base image, and will strictly need to pull down the packages your build needs.

To update solbuild, run:

```bash
sudo solbuild update
```

## Setting up a Build Directory

Create a packaging directory to hold sub-directories with packaging files. Here we are using the name `solus-builds` and placing it in our home directory, but you can use whatever you prefer.

```bash
mkdir ~/solus-builds
cd solus-builds
```

Next you need to set up `common`. This is a repository with a set of make scripts which enable you to more easily manage, build, check, and publish packages.

Change into the directory you will keep the folders for the packages you will be building and clone the common repository with git. For instance if you have a package directory `/home/user/solus-builds` you would run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsolus/common.git
```

Next you need to set up a few symlinks. Do this from the same directory you executed the `git` command:

```bash
ln -sv common/Makefile.common .
ln -sv common/Makefile.toplevel Makefile
ln -sv common/Makefile.iso .
```

Your packaging folder should look something similar to this:

```
└── solus-builds
   ├── common
   │  ├── *lots of stuff, not shown here*
   ├── Makefile -> common/Makefile.toplevel
   ├── Makefile.common -> common/Makefile.common
   └── Makefile.iso -> common/Makefile.iso
```

##  Recommended aliases
Consider creating these aliases in your `.bashrc` file (or equivalent for the zsh or fish shell).

The script `common/Scripts/yauto.py` is used to create an initial `package.yml` file for packages that aren't yet in the repository.

```bash
alias fetchYml="$HOME/solus-builds/common/Scripts/yauto.py"
```

The script `common/Scripts/epcsearch.py` is used to find packages that satisfy build dependencies.

```bash
alias epcsearch='~/packaging/common/Scripts/epcsearch.py'
```

The `yupdate` tool is used when updating packages.

```bash
alias updatePackage='/usr/share/ypkg/yupdate.py'
```

## Building Packages

Your system is now set up for package work.

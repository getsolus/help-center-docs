These are general recommendations. Your requirements may vary based on your intended use of the system.

:::info

Desktop environments that are more feature rich (such as GNOME and KDE Plasma) use the graphics card for 3D-acceleration, when possible. They will benefit from dedicated and more powerful GPUs. Older graphics cards may not support acceleration:

- Intel prior to GMA9xx
- NVIDIA prior to NV30 (GeForce FX5xxx series)
- Radeon prior to R300 (Radeon 9500)

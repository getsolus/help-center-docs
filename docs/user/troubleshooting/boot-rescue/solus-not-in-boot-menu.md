# Solus does not appear in the startup menu

## Cause

After a software update, Solus might disappear from the startup menu. This situation commonly occurs on systems using a legacy startup method (non-UEFI systems) where another Linux distribution owns the startup manager (such as GRUB).

## Procedure
- To restore access to Solus, access the other operating system and update the startup manager. 

  For more information, check the documentation of your distribution.

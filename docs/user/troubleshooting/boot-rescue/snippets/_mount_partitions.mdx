To recover your system, you need to mount the Solus root (`/`) partition and all other partitions your system uses.

1. Open a terminal.
1. Mount the Solus root partition:

   1. Access as the root user by using the following command:

      ```bash
      sudo su
      ```

   2. Create a directory to serve as the mount point for your Solus system:

      ```bash
      mkdir /target
      ```

   3. Find the drive and partition of your Solus system using the `lsblk` command.

      After running the command, the system displays a list of all the drives in your computer:

      ```
      NAME                  MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
      sda                     8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk
      ├─sda1                  8:1    0   512M  0 part
      ├─sda2                  8:2    0   234G  0 part
      └─sda3                  8:3    0     4G  0 part [SWAP]
      sdb                     8:16   0 465.8G  0 disk
      ├─sdb1                  8:17   0     1G  0 part
      └─sdb2                  8:18   0 464.8G  0 part
        ├─SolusSystem-root  253:0    0 234.3G  0 lvm
        ├─SolusSystem-swap  253:1    0   3.7G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
      sdc                     8:32   1  14.9G  0 disk
      ├─sdc1                  8:33   1   4.2G  0 part /cdrom
      └─sdc2                  8:34   1   4.1M  0 part
      nvme0n1               259:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
      ├─nvme0n1p1           259:1    0   500M  0 part
      ├─nvme0n1p2           259:2    0    16M  0 part
      ├─nvme0n1p3           259:3    0   475G  0 part
      └─nvme0n1p4           259:4    0   1.4G  0 part
      ```

      You can use drive size or the number of partitions in each drive to determine which one is your Solus drive.

      :::tip

      If you installed Solus on a _SATA_ drive, the name of the drive might be `sdX` (For example, `sda`). If you installed Solus on an _NVMe_ drive, the name of the drive might be `nvme#n#` (For example `nvme0n1`).

      :::

      Write down the name of the drive and the type.

   4. If the type of your drive is **lvm** or if your drive is encrypted:

      1. Check if the drive is encrypted.

         Encrypted drives do not have the label **decrypted** after the drive name:

         ```bash
         sdb                     8:16   0 465.8G  0 disk
         ├─sdb1                  8:17   0     1G  0 part
         └─sdb2                  8:18   0 464.8G  0 part
           ├─SolusSystem-root  253:0    0   100G  0 lvm
           └─SolusSystem-swap  253:1    0     8G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
         ```

         Decrypted drives have the label **decrypted** after the drive name:

         ```bash
         sdb                     8:16     0 465.8G  0 disk
         ├─sdb1                  8:17     0     1G  0 part
         └─sdb2                  8:18     0 464.8G  0 part
          └─decrypted           253:1    0   238G  0 crypt
             ├─SolusSystem-root  253:0    0 234.3G  0 lvm
             └─SolusSystem-swap  253:1    0   3.7G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
         ```

      1. If your drive is encrypted, use `cryptsetup` to decrypt it.

         ```bash
         cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/partitionName decrypted
         ```

         For example

         ```bash
         cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 decrypted
         ```

   1. Mount the Solus root partition:

      - If your drive's type is _lvm_
        ```bash
        mount /dev/mapper/SolusSystem-Root /target
        ```
      - Otherwise:
        ```bash
        mount /dev/sdX# /target
        ```

1. If your computer uses UEFI, mount the EFI system partition:

   In new installations, the EFI system partition (also known as ESP) is usually 1 GB in size. For older installations, the partition is usually 512 MB in size.

   1. Use `fdisk` to check the partitions of your drive:

      - If you have a SATA drive:
        ```bash
        fdisk -o Device,Size,Type -l /dev/sdX
        ```
      - If you have an NVMe drive:
      
        ```bash
        fdisk -o Device,Size,Type -l /dev/nvme0nX
        ```
      
        The system displays something similar to this:
      
        ```bash
        Device       Size Type
        /dev/sda1    512M EFI System
        /dev/sda2  111.3G Linux filesystem
        ```
      
        In this case, the EFI system partition is `/dev/sda1`

1. Mount the EFI system partition:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdX# /target/boot
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sda1 /target/boot
   ```

1. Mount other partitions your system might have (for example, `/home`):

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdX# /target/home
   ```

1. Chroot to your Solus system:

   Chroot allows you to execute commands and use utilities from your main system directly. This is necessary to do specific repairs like fixing the bootloader.

   1. Run the following commands:
      ```bash
      mount --types proc /proc /target/proc
      mount --rbind /dev /target/dev
      mount --rbind /sys /target/sys
      mount --make-rslave /target/dev
      mount --make-rslave /target/sys
      ```
   1. Chroot into your system:
      ```bash
      chroot /target
      ```

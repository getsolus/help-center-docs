## Cause

This issue might happen when the `/etc/fstab` file contains an entry for a storage device that isn't available during system startup, for example, disconnected USB drives or unavailable network file system (NFS) mounts.

When trying to mount the device, the system fails and displays an emergency shell or error message.

## Before your start

For this procedure, you need:

- [A Solus live USB](../../quick-start/installation/#creating-bootable-media)
- Your disk encryption password, if your system is encrypted

## Procedure

1. Shut down your system.
1. Boot from a Solus live USB.
1. Mount the partitions of your Solus system.

   </details>

1. Prevent the system from trying to mount unavailable devices.

   <details>
1. Edit `/etc/fstab` using `nano`:
	```bash
	nano /etc/fstab
	```
2. Find all the unavailable devices.
3. Add the `noauto` option to the line corresponding to the unavailable device.

   For example:

   ```bash
   UUID=XXXXXX  /mnt/mydisk  exfat  noauto,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0022  0  0
   ```

   4. Save the file and restart your system.

1. Unmount all the Solus partitions.

## Before your start

For this procedure, you need:

- [A Solus Live USB](../../quick-start/installation/#creating-bootable-media)
- Your disk encryption password, if your system is encrypted
- A stable internet connection

## Procedure

1. Shut down your system.
1. Boot from a Solus live USB.
1.  Mount the partitions of your Solus system.

1. Check the chroot environment has internet connection.
    <details>
    	1. Connect your computer to the internet.
    	2. Run `ping -c 4 google.com` in the chroot environment.

           If the chroot environment has internet connection, the system displays the following:

           ```bash
           PING google.com (142.250.196.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
           64 bytes from nctsaa-ac-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.196.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=4.26 ms

           rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 4.261/5.613/6.344/0.803 ms
           ```
        3. If the chroot environment *does not* have an internet connection:
        	1. Exit the chroot environment:

        	   ```bash
        	   exit
        	   ```

        	2. Run the following commands:

        	   ```bash
        	   cp /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /target/run/systemd/resolve/
        	   cd /target/etc
               ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /target/etc/resolv.conf
        	   ```

        	3. Go back to the chroot environment:

        	   ```bash
        	   chroot /target
        	   ```

        	4. Test the internet connection again.

    	Follow the appropriate steps depending on your situation:

        	<summary>My system stopped working after a *failed* update.</summary>
        	1. Rebuild the package database:

        	   ```bash
        	   sudo eopkg rebuild-db
        	   ```

        	2. Update your system:

        	   ```bash
        	   sudo eopkg up
        	   ```

        	3. Check if your system still has broken packages:

        	   ```bash
        	   sudo eopkg check -y
        	   ```

        	   If you see output that starts with "Usage", the system has no broken packages.

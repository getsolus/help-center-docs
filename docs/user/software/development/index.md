# Development

Solus provides a stable foundation for creating, testing, and deploying applications.

You can install tools such as text editors, programming languages, compilers, and version control systems. Solus also supports containerization and virtualization technologies.

## Getting started

If you want to compile and develop software using Solus, we recommend installing the `system.devel` component.

```bash
sudo eopkg install -c system.devel
```

The `system.devel` component installs libraries and packages for software development, such as `clang`, `gcc`, and `make`.

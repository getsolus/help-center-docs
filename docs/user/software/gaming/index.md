# Gaming

You can play a wide variety of games on Solus: 

- Native Linux Games: Run games developed specifically for the Linux platform.
- Windows Games: Play many Windows games using compatibility layers like Steam (Proton) and Lutris.
- Emulated Games: Use emulators to enjoy games from classic consoles and computer systems.

Solus includes drivers for many popular graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD, along with support for many gamepads and controllers. This provides a solid foundation for your gaming experience.

Many games, particularly those run through Steam (Proton) or Lutris, work well on Solus. However, some titles might require specific configuration or adjustments to run correctly.

## Getting started

Gaming platforms like Lutris, RetroArch, and Steam are available in the package repository. You can also find many open-source games there, such as Freeciv, OpenTTD, Red Eclipse, and Warzone 2100.

Alternatively, you can also install games and applications from FlatHub.

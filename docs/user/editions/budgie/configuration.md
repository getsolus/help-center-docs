## Date and Time

In Budgie, the easiest way to access the date and time settings is by left clicking on the time in the bottom panel and clicking on "Time and date settings".

![Budgie Date and Time Right-Click](configuration/budgie-time-and-date-right-click.jpg)

Alternatively, you can open the Settings Menu and then click on "Details" and then "Date & Time" in the System Settings section.

You will be presented with the following window. This window provides you with the ability to enable / disable automatic date & time, automatic time zone changing, and the time format.

If you wish to change how the time is displayed in the bottom panel, left click on the time and click "Preferences". You can now show the date, seconds or use 24 hour time.

## Default Applications

You can configure default applications in Budgie by opening the Budgie Menu and then clicking on "Details" in the System Settings category.

Upon entering the Details section, click on "Default Applications" and then use the drop down boxes to select a different default application for each category. For most categories, you will need to have installed alternative applications before you can change the default settings. For instance, if you wish to change the default video player from GNOME MPV to VLC then you must first install VLC (available in the Software Center).

![Budgie Default Applications](configuration/budgie-configuring-default-applications.jpg)

_Note: In the image above, we've changed the Web browser and Photo viewer._

You can specify default applications for individual file types by right clicking on a file and then clicking on "Open With Other Application".

![Budgie Context Menu](configuration/budgie-open-with-right-click.jpg)

Next, select the application you wish to use from the list. You may need to click "View All Applications" if you can't see the one you would like to use. Finish by clicking "Select". In the future, all files with the same file type will open with the same application.

title: Getting Involved
---

There are many ways you can get involved with the Solus Project. Contributing package updates is only one way to help out the project. Some of them don't even involve any packaging or software knowledge.

No matter how you wish to contribute, the best place to start is joining our [Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#solus:matrix.org). There you'll find a helpful community willing to answer any questions you may have.

Matrix is an open protocol for decentralized, secure communication.

You can access Matrix spaces with dedicated clients. Solus has packaged [Element](https://element.io), [Neochat](https://apps.kde.org/neochat/), and [Nheko](https://nheko-reborn.github.io). Other clients are available as Flatpaks. See [here](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/) for more information on Matrix clients.

## Packaging contributions

One of the most visible ways of helping the project is by updating and maintaining packages. The Solus repository contains thousands of packages, which is a lot for a small team to handle. We are always welcoming and appreciative of assistance in maintaining software in the repository.

Getting started with packaging is generally pretty easy. If you are looking to help with packaging, check out our [packaging documentation](/packaging).

## Filing issues

A great way to help out the project is by filing issues for problems that you are experiencing. Filed issues makes it much easier to track problems that people are having. They help ensure that nothing gets forgotten, and lets both you and us know when they've been resolved. Issues should be opened against our [packages repository](https://github.com/getsolus/packages/issues).

:::note
When filing an issue, please be as detailed as possible. The more details there are, the easier it is to understand the problem.

Issues are also a great way to let us know that a piece of software in the repository is out-of-date. Package update requests help the team prioritize updating particular pieces of software. They let us know what software is out-of-date, how far out-of-date it is, and that there is demand for that particular software.

## Documentation

Good and up-to-date documentation is a very valuable resource. Contributing to our Help Center documentation not only helps us, it helps the entire community. It's also easier than packaging. If writing help articles is something you are interested in, head on over to our [Help Center repository](https://github.com/getsolus/help-center-docs) on GitHub. The project Readme has all the information you need to get started.

## Financial

Another way to contribute to Solus without needing any technical skills or time is financially. Solus is a volunteer-run project, and we rely on donations from the community to keep the lights on. We understand that donating money can be tough, especially in these challenging times. As such, we are very grateful to everyone who contributes financially to the project. If this is something you want and are able to do, head over to our page on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/getsolus).

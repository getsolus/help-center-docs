The Solus Project has a few core values that inform all of our decision-making.

## Transparency

As a team, we strive to be as transparent as possible with our community about the decisions that we make. We believe that it is important for our community to be able to see what we're doing and why. It builds trust between the Solus team and the community. When users understand the decision-making process, in-progress development, and reasons for our choices, they feel more confident in our direction.

A part of transparency is accountability. By being open about our work, the team can take responsibility for both successes and failures, building a culture of continual improvement.

To be transparent, we:

- Are proactive with our communication with the community via our forum and social media.
- Encourage discussion on our [public forum](https://discuss.getsol.us), [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#solus:matrix.org), and [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@solus).
- Make all financial transactions visible via our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/getsolus#category-BUDGET).

## Stability

Users want to use a stable operating system, and so do we. It's never a good experience when something breaks after downloading and installing updates, and even moreso when you have to get things done. Thus, we believe it is important to provide a stable system for people to use.

There are a few ways we accomplish this:

- Use a "stable-rolling" model: Install once and update forever.
- Don't update packages to new versions just for the sake of having the latest version.
- Test all package updates before pushing them to all users.
- Be responsive about addressing new issues.

All software has bugs, and inevitably, some will slip through the cracks. However, we believe that our approach and methodology strike the best balance between having the latest software and having the greatest stability.

## Community

Community is the heartbeat of Solus. Our community is where users can come together to share knowledge, solve problems, and collaborate on projects. Having a strong community helps ensure that we can be responsive to the needs of our users. It enables us to evolve and improve, while keeping our users' interests in mind.

When our users feel valued and supported, they are more likely to stick with us, encouraging long-term engagement. Further, having a diverse community provides more points of view about developments and issues, which is very valuable for a smaller team like ours.

Lastly, a supportive community leads to faster problem-solving. Users can provide assistance to other users quickly. This improves the overall user experience and can prevent problems from escalating.

The most important aspect of our community is Kindness. Being kind makes people feel welcome, and more likely to stick around, thus strengthening our community.

# Help Center Documentation

This is the repository for Solus's future Help Center documentation as well as previous User Guide. This repository exists to help facilitate and encourage community contributions to improving our 
documentation and enabling an easier user experience for everyone.

Stumbled on this repo and have no idea what any of this is? Check out the [Solus](https://solus-project.com) operating system!

## TODO

*In order.*

- [x] The current task is to migrate all documentation from the [Solus Wiki](https://wiki.solus-project.com).
- [ ] Leveraging this repo in the creation of our Help Center.
- [ ] Create a basic build system that aggregates specific Markdown files and assets to produce a User Guide. This will enable our User Guides to be generated whenever necessary, such as during the release 
of a new ISO snapshot.

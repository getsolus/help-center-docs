# Building a Package

This guide will walk you through setting up the file(s), tooling, and building your package.

## Setting up Packager file

In order to utilise the build system, you must first set up a configuration file that has your packager details.

This file lives in the `.solus` folder of your home directory. You will need to create the `.solus` folder as well as the inner `packager` file. Inside the packager file, you need two keys, `Name` and `Email`. This is used when generating the machine 
file so that the packager details are stored within the resulting binary package.

``` ini
[Packager]
Name=Your Name Here
Email=your.email@address
```

## Using solbuild

The `solbuild` tool must first be initialized with a base image. All builds thereafter will use this as a base, and construct a temporary overlay root to save on time and disk space in builds.

### Initializing solbuild

First, install the system.devel component by calling: `sudo eopkg it -c system.devel`

Next, install solbuild itself with `sudo eopkg it solbuild`. If you are building against unstable, also install `solbuild-config-unstable`.

Next, you need to initialize solbuild via `sudo solbuild init`

This will take some time as it downloads and prepares the image. It is a good idea to update the root on a semi-regular basis, otherwise the updates will be applied on every build.

### Updating solbuild

It is a good idea to keep the base image updated. It will help reduce build times by not having to repeatedly download updates to packages in the base image, and will strictly need to pull down the packages your build needs.

To update solbuild, run: `sudo solbuild update`

## Setting up common

Next you need to set up `common`, a set of make scripts that enables you to more easily manage, build, check, and publish packages.

You need to clone the common repository with git `sudo eopkg it git` by doing `git clone https://dev.solus-project.com/source/common.git` in the same directory you will have sub-folders for packages you are building.

Next you need to set up symlinks. Do this from the same directory you executed the `git` command:

``` bash
ln -sv common/Makefile.common .
ln -sv common/Makefile.toplevel Makefile
ln -sv common/Makefile.iso .
```

Next, inside the **folder** of the **package** you are building, run: `echo "include ../Makefile.common" > Makefile`

This will enable you to call `make` commands from inside the package folder.

Your folder should look something similar to this:

```
| common/
| your-package/
| - Makefile
| Makefile
| Makefile.common
| Makefile.iso
```

## Building packages (Solus only)

After setting up common, you can now build the package. Note that build dependencies and such will be installed locally (in the chroot environment).

``` bash
make
```

You will be prompted to enter your password by sudo so dependencies may be downloaded and the necessary eopkg files may be generated.

You may find other `common` commands [here](https://dev.solus-project.com/source/common/browse/master/about/).

Once youâ€™ve achieved a successful build, the resulting `.eopkg` files will be moved to the current directory, along with the machine file, `pspec_*.xml` (currently `pspec_x86_64.xml`). We recommending checking the contents of your 
generated eopkg file(s) to ensure everything is located in the appropriate locations. You can do this by using `lseopkg file_name.eopkg`.

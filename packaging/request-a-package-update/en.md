# Requesting A Package Update 

Packages updates are typically provided by community or dedicated package maintainers, however if we are not shipping the latest stable release of a package, you can let us know using our [Task Tracker](https://dev.solus-project.com/)

**Please look to see if an update request has been filed for the software or library you require**. 

If there isn't an existing request, you can use the template below for requesting to update a package - Note that updates solely for a new version number, platform-specific updates (such as to macOS or Windows) which aren't relevant, or solely translation updates, are generally not accepted or not prioritized.

Please provide the following information:

- Title of Task: `Update $packagename to $version`  Example: `Update nano to 2.9.7`
- Description: Explanation as to the value-add of updating this package. 
- Link to source tarball/zip file
- master.zip files **are not permitted**. We require versioned tarballs, for example: "1.2.3.tar.gz".
- Use the tag **Software** for tagging your update request

Please put this information into a new [task](https://dev.solus-project.com/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/)

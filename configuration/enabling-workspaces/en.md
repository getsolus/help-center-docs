# Enabling Workspaces

Each of the supported desktop environments in Solus provide support for workspaces, enabling you to group various application windows into their own dedicated space and switch between them.

## Budgie

Budgie enables the switching of workspaces via the Workspace Switcher. You can enable workspaces in Budgie by adding the Workspace Switcher applet to your panel.

To add the Workspace Switcher to your panel, open the Budgie Menu and then click on "Budgie Desktop Settings" in the System Tools category. Alternatively, you can access the Budgie Desktop Settings by opening Raven (`Super + A`) and clicking on the settings icon at the bottom of Raven.

Once you have opened Budgie Settings, click on the panel you wish to edit in the left-hand menu.

In the Applets section, click the `+` button.

Scroll down the list to find the Workspace Switcher entry, select it, and then click the "Add applet" button at the top of the panel. Note, you can double click on an entry to add it instantly without having to click the "Add applet" button.

In addition to using keyboard shortcuts, you will now be able to switch workspaces by clicking on them in the bottom panel.  You can also drag one workspace onto another in the bottom panel which will move the current active application to the new workspace.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

MATE provides a variety of keyboard shortcuts for workspaces.  By default, the keyboard shortcuts for switching directly to a certain workspace are disabled.

To enable these and to also view all other available shortcuts open the Brisk Menu and click on "Preferences" and then on "Keyboard Shortcuts".  The workspace shortcuts are listed under Windows Management.

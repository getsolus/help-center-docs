# Enabling Desktop Icons

You can enable or disable desktop icons easily depending on your personal preference.

## Budgie

With Budgie, start by opening Raven, either by clicking on its icon in the far right of the system tray or using the keyboard shortcut `Super + A`.  Next, click the cog icon for Budgie Settings and then toggle "Desktop Icons" on under the Background section.

You may now add things to your Desktop.  This can be done by dragging an item onto the Desktop or by right clicking an icon and selecting Copy to / Move to Desktop.  Alternatively, open the Budgie Menu and click on "Files" and then move the files you want to the Desktop folder (as shown in the image below).  Please note, the Desktop folder is not visible in "Files" until you've enabled the Desktop icons.

In GNOME, you can enable desktop items by opening the Overlay using the `Super` button on your keyboard or by clicking the Applications icon in the dock and then search for and open "Tweak Tool".  You can then toggle them on and off by clicking "Icons on Desktop" under the Desktop section.

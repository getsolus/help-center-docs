You can enable desktop icons by opening Raven, clicking the cog wheel for Budgie Settings, then toggling Desktop Icons on under the Background section.

You may now add things to your Desktop by:
1. Opening the file manager
2. Moving the files you want to the Desktop folder (as shown in the image below).

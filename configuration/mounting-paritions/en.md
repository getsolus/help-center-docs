# Automatically mounting internal partitions

Solus can automatically mount your internal partitions on startup.

## Budgie & GNOME

First, open the application Disks. Select the disk from the left you want to automatically mount. 
Click on the gear icons to show additional partition options. Select to edit mount options. 
Next, disable automatic mount options. Select to mount the partition at startup and to show the disk in the user interface. 
Define a display name and finish the procedure. On next startup, your internal partition should be automatically mounted
and be displayed in your file manager.

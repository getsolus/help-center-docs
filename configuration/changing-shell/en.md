# Changing Shell

When using a terminal session to perform command-line activities, a Unix shell is used to interpret commands. The default shell on Solus is Bash, however changing your shell may enable additional features and functionality.

Solus makes available other shells via our repository, with a full list available in `/usr/share/defaults/etc/shells`. Common shells, aside from Bash, are:

- [Dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)

## Installation

In order to use a shell different from Bash, you may need to install the respective package for the shell to be able to work. You will find thoses packages in the Software-Center within the *System utilities* category, or via the command-line with `sudo eopkg install <Name of the Shell>`.

Example:

``` bash
sudo eopkg install fish
```

## Switching

To switch to another shell, first install the appropriate package, followed by the command `chsh` (change shell) to change the shell for your user session, using the path provided in `/usr/share/defaults/etc/shells`. Lastly you need to log out and back in again for the change to take effect.

Example:

- For Zsh: `chsh -s /bin/zsh`

- For Fish: `chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`

## Troubleshooting

If the default shell is not changed, you must add the shell to `/etc/shells` via the command `sh` with `sudo`.

Example:

- For Zsh: `echo "/bin/zsh" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`

- For Fish: `echo "/usr/bin/fish" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`

# nginx

Solus provides the nginx web server and proxy to users and developers who want to test their web applications before setting them to production.

Remember that Solus is not a server operating system: any usage outside the local testing is discouraged.

## Installation

nginx is available in the `nginx` package. It can be installed from the [Software Center](https://getsol.us/articles/common-tasks/installing-and-updating-software/en/) or via terminal:

```bash
sudo eopkg install nginx
```

## Usage

### Configuration

nginx, as many other packages in the Solus repository, is [stateless](https://clearlinux.org/features/stateless). That means the package gets installed with a vendored configuration out-of-the-box which can be customized, or even overridden, by a privileged user.

nginx on Solus is designed to read users' configuration files from `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`. It is possible to manually create these directories and put personal files in there to customize nginx's behavior. To revert back to the original settings, just delete `/etc/nginx/`.

### Management

Basic nginx management is done via systemd, using the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx # To enable nginx on startup and run it immediately.
sudo systemctl stop nginx   # To stop nginx.
```

More details about `systemctl` are available [at this address](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html).

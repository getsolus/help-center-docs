*Your window should look fairly similar to the one below.*

To manage your or other’s accounts, you first need to authenticate. Click the Unlock button in the top right corner and type your password. Note that you are required to be an administrator. If you're the only user on 
the system, then your account is an administrator by default.

In the event it is correct, the Unlock button will change to Lock and the Add / Remove buttons will be clickable.

### Adding a User

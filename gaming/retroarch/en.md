# Retroarch

Retroarch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players. It has all you need to run classic games through its polished graphical interface.

## Install the assets

The assets are not packaged with Retroarch itself and have to be downloaded from inside the program. This can easily be done by going into the Online Updater from the Main Menu and selecting "Update Assets".
